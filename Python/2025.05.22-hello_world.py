## Hello World (Following course on Udemy)

### Step 1: Using Sublime Text  
We wrote our first Python code in Sublime Text:

```python
print('hello world')

We saved the file on the desktop as myexample.py so the system knows it's Python code.

### Step 2: Running the code via CMD

In Command Prompt:

cd Desktop  
python myexample.py

The terminal responded with hello world.

Alternative method (less recommended):

You can also open Python directly in CMD:

python  
>>> print('hello world')  
>>> print('hello')

But this method is not recommended, because you can only write and run one line at a time.

To exit Python in CMD:

quit()

### Step 3: Using Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda)

We opened myexample.py from the Desktop using Jupyter Notebook.
You can also start a new notebook by choosing:

Jupyter → New → Python 3

There, we can write:

print('hello world')  
print('hello')  
print('new')

To run the code:
Click "Run" or press Shift + Enter.

And that’s our first "Hello World" in Python!
